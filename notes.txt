look into these:

  promises
    - async actions in javascript
    - object returned after async action
    - resolved (can call a function) or rejected (different function)
    - flatter than callback model

  es6 modules
    - es6_module_transpiler-rails (~> 0.3.0)
      - cross compiles es6 files into an 'amd' js namespace (?)
    - add to javascript: class definitions, promises, modules
    - avoid namespace collisions

> brew install node

Add to gemfile:
gem 'ember-appkit-rails'

> rvm use 2.0


jquery is a requirement for ember
but jquery-ujs is unnecessary (but prob no conflicts)
turbolinks is incompatible with ember

views not used -- rely on ember for output
